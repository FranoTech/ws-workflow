Image Processing is an invaluable tool in bio-medical research today. With the increasing size and higher quality of medical images, the image analysis systems become more popular and necessary. Especially, the cancer cell images analysis has been studied for years in order to segment cells from the environment. Segmentation methods is considered as one of important techniques to perform the cancer cell image analysis system. There are various solutions to segment the cancel cells that give similar outputs. On the other hand, it is rather hard to find the best solution.

In our case study, the PSU cell image analyzer [] is a computer-aid system for analyzing microscopic images. The system is performed an automatically counting the numbers of nuclear stained breast cancer cell as an assistant system in pathological analysis of the breast cancer. The researchers were proposed the various ways in order  to perform the segmentation of breast cancer cell images. In 2007 they presented the use of color based segmentation using back-propagation neural networks []. This method shows how to separate the positive and negative cancer cells from cell image background. In 2008, the researchers proposed a new method for segmenting using K-Mean Clustering[] which can be used to increases the performance of previous research. They also proposed a new approach on segmenting breast cancer cells which perform color space transformation, global thresholding method, and morphological operations in 2009 []. The newest method they presented in 2010 is to use extracted feature technique to classify the cell type. These all proposed methods give similar results but their performances are slightly different. We use this system as a case study of the thesis. Analyzing these processes and their effects may be taken time. So we will use a workflow system to help the programmer to quickly design the processing steps of the cancer cell analysis.

In traditional programming, the developers write the source code, compile it  and run. when the program has some faults, they have to recheck the source code, find the errors and rerun the program again. Even if they want to edit some parameters. It also would be harder to deal with this practical in image processing field. There are many different algorithms, more ways to design a image processing process that get the proper results. This is time and resource consuming. In addition, the present images used in the cell analysis are quite large and need more computing resources to ease process.

Our research applies a workflow system in order to the process of designing steps .The work-flow system helps the user to create a workflow diagram as they want.
This work mainly studies on improving the performance of the PSU cancer cell analysis system that has been developed since 2008. Our system will help the programming to develop optimized workflow diagrams and improve the system performance based on the case study.
