I. Introduction
Traditionally in most scientific processes, to obtain the satisfactory results, the researchers had to perform an experiment through repeated cycles. Also in image processing analysis, proper results can be achieved in various ways as there are many different algorithms to design in image processing processes. A great number of procedures will be conducted. For example, in the PSU cancer cell analyzer, which is our case study, there are various solutions for segmenting the cancel cells that give similar outputs. It is time and resource consuming to tediously and manually compare which is the best solution.

A workflow system can help programmers to quickly design and re-design the processing steps. In this work, we explore and enhance Taverna Workbench, a workflow software for bioinformatic, to assist programmers for analyzing image processing algorithms. This is visual and codeless. Even non-experts programmers can create a practical workflow. The block diagram of some frequently used image processing algorithms can be defined. The programmers can graphically control input, output and simulation variable via the data-link. They should not need to be familiar with the detail of the back-end systems.

Our system will help the programming to develop optimized workflow diagrams and improve the system performance. Our case study in this paper is the PSU cancer cell analysis system that has been developed since 2008.

II. Taverna Workbench
Taverna Workbench [] is an open source scientific workflow environment includes the GUI-based workflow composer and a workflow executive engine. The Workbench consists of a set of processors which representing various kinds of software component such as web services, java classes and local script. The editor allows user  to easily create a workflow by  graphically dragging element into the workflow editor and connected the wires to each block in order to control the data flow.
