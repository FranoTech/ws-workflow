Traditional, the iterative method is a key of scientific processes. To obtain the satisfactory results, the researchers have to perform an experiment through repeated cycles. Also in image processing applications, developers write the source code, compile it and run the executable program. When the program has some error, the developers have to recheck the source code, find the errors and rerun the program again even if they want to edit some parameters. However, it is even harder when the proper results can be achieved in various ways as there are many different algorithms to design image processing processes. For example, the PSU cancer cell analyzer, which is used to study in our research, was proposed that there are various solutions for segmenting the cancel cells that give similar outputs. It is time and resource consuming to tediously and manually compare which is the best solution.

In order to reduce the design process time

With the increasing size and higher quality of medical images at this time, Image analysis systems become more popular and necessary . The cancer cell images analysis has been studied for years. Segmentation methods are considered as one of important techniques to perform cancer cell image analysis system. There are various solutions for segmenting the cancel cells that give similar outputs. On the other hand, it is rather hard to find the best solution.
